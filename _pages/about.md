Welcome to my website!

I am currently an assistant professor at the [Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.iitd.ac.in/), [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/).

My research is centered around the goal of enabling autonomous systems to make decisions safely and effectively in uncertain, real-world environments. Some representative research directions include [imitation learning from human demonstrations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9990591), joint human-AI decision making, [planning missions for autonomous inspection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10256361), and [safe learning in autonomous agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01370). Towards these research threads, I leverage tools from reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and robotics.

I am currently teaching a course on [Reinforcement Learning](https://raunakbh92.github.io/AIL722-Fall24/CourseWebpage_Fall2024.html).

Brief Bio:
Previously, I was a postdoc in the [GOALS lab](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/goals/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](http://ori.ox.ac.uk/) working with [Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/). I obtained my PhD from Stanford University under the guidance of [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/). I completed my MS from Georgia Tech in and my BTech from IIT Bombay.
